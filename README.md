This is a practical project on a tourism website template. I've used HTML5, Tailwindcss, and Alpine js to implement the template. the template is entirely responsive. the template has features such as dark and light mode and either right to left or left to right direction that you can set with a click on the flag in the navbar. the default language of the template is Persian. my point of implementing the template was to indicate my skills in Tailwindcss and I hope that I've been able to point my skill in using Tailwindcss to dear you.
